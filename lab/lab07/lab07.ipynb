For example, if we make our first split based on whether or not `mpg <= M`, we'll have some average MSRP for the low-MPG cars (below `M`), along with residuals if we used that average to predict the MSRP for all the low-MPG cars. Similarly, we have the same information for the high-MPG cars (above `M`). A good value of `M` will make the mean squared residuals for the two groups as small as possible. So, at each node, we choose a split that makes the mean squared error on each side as small as possible.\n",
